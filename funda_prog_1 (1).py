Interpreter (line by line compiler) vs Compiler (Entire program compiler)
Python is an interpreter language

How a python program runs? using Intepreter
write a code in a filesystem -> python progname.py -> interpreter read line by line -> check syntax/semantics -> convert to byte code (given line)->
load the bytecode to python virtual machine (RAM) (every time the code will be loaded in the memory) -> CPU will read the bytecode line of the program -> execute it (using RAM as a memory area for holding variables/values/dataset/libraries etc.,)

How a scala program runs? using compiler

While compiling:
write a code in a filesystem -> compile entire program once for all spending some time scalac/javac-> scala code loaded the entire bytecode to java virtual machine (RAM) (first time alone) for compiling  -> compiled code produced as an output in the filesystem

While Executing:
While we execute the code, complete bytecode will be loaded into memory -> CPU will read the bytecode of the program -> execute it (using RAM as a memory area for holding variables/values/dataset etc.,)

vi we43scalaobj.scala

object we43prog extends App
{
val totalnumofasp=70;
print("total number of aspirants is " + totalnumofasp)
}

scalac we43scalaobj.scala
scala we43prog

How a python program use interpreter
vi we43pythonclass.py
class we43prog:
    totalnumofasp=70;
    print("Hello team")
    print("total number of aspirants is " + str(totalnumofasp))
python we43pythonclass.py

Basic programming fundamentals -
Variables & Values & its properties, Comment, STD input/output, block/intend of coding
Operators
Applying some builtin functions
Data types (simple/complex)
Conditional structure
Looping Constructs

2. Specific to Python
OOPS - Framework developers (eg. commiters/contributors of apache spark)
Exception Handling
**FBP - Dataengineers (eg. leverage the spark functions writtern by somebody)

What is a Python Programming Language?
Python is an Intend based, Interpreter (not a compiler based prog lang), high-level (not a boiler plate/low level prog lang), general-purpose (Usage of python libraries across other tools/frameworks is easy) programming language.
Scripting prog.
Func based prog.
Object oriented prog.

for i in list(['weblog_UK.json','weblog_US.json']):
    a=len(i)
    print("total records in ",i,a)

b=100
print(b)

Linux is not an intend based program, it is a block based rather:
for i in weblog*
do
  a=`wc -l $i`
  echo "total records in $i is $a"
done

#Why Python uses indend based programing ->
#1. Managing the program more efficiently
#2. Better Readablility of the code
#3. For creating the hierarchy of programming.
#4. By default 4 spaces we will give for indends, but more/less spaces or tabs also can be used...

#Indendation is needed for (hierarchy of programming), because we are doing block operation (lines of code) with in the for loop

#list

#Why we need collection types?
#To manage/store/parse the complex dataset in a hirarchical/nested/complex structure stored or to process semi structure data, nested data,
# dynamic schema-ful data (avro), variable data/metadata, for a data or metadata driven approaches..

#Different characteristics of collection types?
#Iterable (looping), mutable (changable) - updatable (modifyable) & resizable (added/removed), accessible (select using index, position, value, key)

#EXCEPTION HANDLING
#Understanding of Exception: what, exception handler blocks (try,except,else,finally)
#Exception handling methodologies: Block level or Statement level
#Types of Exception: Predefined (TypeError, ValueError, KeyError,DivideByZero,IndexError,FileNotFound..) & Userdefined/CustomExceptions
#importance - Dataengineer less (already framework spark or any other handled the exceptions)
#importance - python developer (application/framework/tool/automation) medium (already framework spark handled the exceptions)
#What? - Exception is a error occurrs when the program is executing at any stage for any
# reasons (data error, name/key/value error, type error, environment error, file not found, format error)
# and makes the flow of program terminated abruptly (out of control)
# Exception Handler (graceful handling of program termination by generating logs, messages, alternative codes, releasing of resources, closing of connections)
# help us handle or take the control from the line where main program got terminated - is a construct/code that help us handle the state of exception
#Example:
#exception->exceptional cases, unexpected events, unusual, abnormal..
#1. try - I am going to a store to buy something to my home (plan it perfectly to avoid any unexpected events)
    #take a vehicle
    # go to shop,
    # add different items in the cart,
    # pay the bill,
    # take a vehicle
    # come back home
#2. except - any unexpected event occurs, handle it accordingly
    #exception1 - trip got cancelled because of some other priority work came
    #exception2 - vehicle is not starting, but i may use some other vehicle or go by walk or call the mechanic and abort my journey
    #exception3 - shop is closed
    #exception4 - some products are not available...
    #exp5- card declined/not accepted or wallet is lost
    #exp6 - vehicle is not starting
    #exp7 - something went wrong which i didn't predicted (expect unexpected)
#3. else - (If except doesn't happened) If I am not getting any exception, what I have to do then?
    #ensure to clean, lock your vehicle when you leave the vehicle in the home
#4. finally (If 1+3 or 2  happened) If I am not getting any exception or I got some exception, what I have to do?
    #ensure to clean, lock your vehicle when you leave the vehicle in the home
    #plan for some other alternative journey
